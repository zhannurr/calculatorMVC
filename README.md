# ðŸ§® My Calculator App ðŸ§®

Welcome to my adorable Calculator App! ðŸŒŸ This little project showcases the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern while providing a simple and user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations. ðŸ’–

## ðŸ’» Features

- **Basic Operations:** Perform addition (+), subtraction (âˆ’), multiplication (Ã—), and division (Ã·) with ease! âœ¨
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and intuitive layout using Java Swing, designed with love! ðŸ¥°
- **Error Handling:** Friendly messages for division by zero and invalid input, ensuring a smooth experience. ðŸš«âž—

## ðŸ“œ How It Works

The app is divided into three components:

1. **Model (CalculatorModel):** This is where all the calculations happen. It handles the logic for each operation. ðŸ’¡
2. **View (CalculatorView):** The charming interface that allows users to input numbers and see results. It's designed to be welcoming and easy to use! ðŸŒˆ
3. **Controller (CalculatorController):** The glue that connects the model and view, managing user interactions and updating the interface accordingly. ðŸŽ©
